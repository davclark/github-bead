# GitHub Access Token Installation Instructions

### How to create a Token

An access token can be created at https://github.com/settings/applications.
Under Personal access tokens, click "Generate new token."  The default selected scopes are good enough for what we are doing.


### Getting the Key to Work with issue-tracker.py

In the  ```github-api/``` directory, create a file named ```GitHubAuthKey.txt``` and simply paste the key into the file.  You should be good to go!
